# File system
- hello_triangle.cpp is the main file that runs the OpenGL renderer.
- makefile_test_template.txt contains the makefile contents to compile the hello_triangle executable.

# Use makefile to automate code compilation
1. rename makefile_test_template.txt to "makefile".
2. update paths in makefile to reflect your system.
3. run ```make``` to generate the executable. run ```./hello_triangle``` to run the executable.
4. run ```make clean``` to remove glad.o object file from glad/src and the executable from the current directory
